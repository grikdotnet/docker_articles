# Docker myths and recepies.

When a fifth colleague of mine asked to tell about Docker‬,I understood I should write about it. And I figured, since I run this far, maybe I’d just go on writing. And that’s what I did.

So I got a series of notes, and Nikita Gusakov (@nkt) gave me a hint about uniting them in a book.

If you opened this file directly on github, I recommend you to switch to [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/grikdotnet/docker-myths-and-receipts/details).
